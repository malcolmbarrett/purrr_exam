```{r setup}
library(tidyverse)
library(gapminder)
set.seed(1234)
x_list <- list(x = rnorm(10), y = rnorm(10), z = rnorm(10))
```

## Your Turn 1

1. Read the code in the first chunk and predict what will happen.
2. Run the code in the first chunk. What does it return?

```{r}
list(
  sum_a = sum(x_list$a),
  sum_b = sum(x_list$b),
  sum_c = sum(x_list$c)
)
```

3. Now, use `map()` to create the same output.

```{r}
map(number_list, ___)
```

## Your Turn 2

Pass diabetes to `map()` and map using `class()`. What are these results telling you?

```{r}
map(_____, ______)
```

## Show of Hands

Which of these will throw an error?

```{r}
map(gapminder, class)
map_int(gapminder, class)
map_chr(gapminder, class)
```
